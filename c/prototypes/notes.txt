One character is being swallowed on newline.
Line jumps up too far and cursor is not positioned at the right distance after backspacing through newline.



Program needs to go to the start of the original line, move forward six spaces, then print char count and max_input
Then cursor needs to go forward input->chars + 1 and print next character. If chars > 50, cursor needs to go to next line, and move forward chars - previous_space

newline is inserted
move cursor back max_line_length (* 2?) - previous_space
for i < that value: print space
print newline
for i < that value: print input[chars]
move cursor position
